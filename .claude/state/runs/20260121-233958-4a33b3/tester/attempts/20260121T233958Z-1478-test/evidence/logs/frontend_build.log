   Generating static pages (7/7)

> Export encountered errors on following paths:
    /(auth)/login/page: /login

------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYSIS:
- TypeScript compilation: PASSED (compiled successfully)
- Static generation: FAILED on /login page (unrelated to F008)
- F008 Report page: Not tested during static export

The build error is in the login page, not the report display feature (F008).
This is a pre-existing issue unrelated to F008 implementation.
