## Feature annotations (recommended)

When documenting decisions that are specific to a feature (component touchpoints, tradeoffs, security/observability), tag them with the feature id:

Example:

- `### @F### Service boundary change`
- `- @F### Observability: emit metric ...`

These tags are used by the Feature Packet generator to surface architecture outputs to executor/tester.
