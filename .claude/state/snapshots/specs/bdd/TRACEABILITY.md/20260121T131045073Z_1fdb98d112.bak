# TRACEABILITY — TEMPLATE

> Canonical traceability file. Promoted by `/agi-bdd`.
>
> **IMPORTANT:** Remove the word **TEMPLATE** from the title when publishing a real (promoted) version.
>
> **Machine-readable contract:** The YAML block below is required once BDD exists.

## Inputs

- docs/product/PRD.md
- docs/product/REQUIREMENTS_BASELINE.md
- docs/product/MARKET_BENCHMARK.md
- docs/product/STORY_MAP.md (Launch scope)
- docs/product/USER_STORIES.md
- docs/ux/UX_CONTRACT.md
- docs/ux/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md

## Traceability mapping (authoritative)

> Preferred machine-readable source: `specs/bdd/TRACEABILITY.json`.
>
> Compatibility: the fenced YAML block below is still required by some legacy
> scripts; keep it in sync with TRACEABILITY.json.

```yaml
{
  "traceability": []
}
```

## Human notes

### Rules
- Each `user_story` must exist in `docs/product/USER_STORIES.md`.
- Each `feature` must exist in `features.json`.
- Each `gherkin_file` must exist under `specs/bdd/`.
- Every referenced scenario name must exist in that `.feature` file.
- All **Launch-scope** user stories (from `docs/product/STORY_MAP.md` -> `## Launch`) must map to at least one feature and at least one scenario.

### Common failure patterns
- User story IDs in prose but not in YAML.
- Scenario names drifted (changed in `.feature` but not updated here).
- Missing `@Fxxx` tags in `.feature` scenarios.
