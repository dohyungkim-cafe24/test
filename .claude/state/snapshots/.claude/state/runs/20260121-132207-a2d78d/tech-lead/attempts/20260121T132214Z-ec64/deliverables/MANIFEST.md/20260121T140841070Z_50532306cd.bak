# Deliverables Manifest

- stage: **plan**
- agent: **tech-lead**
- contract_version: **1.6.8**
- write_once: **False**

## Golden rules
- Write all artifacts into this attempt's `deliverables/` directory.
- You **may** revise deliverables in-place within this attempt (preferred for small fixes).
- Do **not** edit `MANIFEST.md` / `MANIFEST.json` (the contract for this attempt).
- Do **not** edit canonical docs directly (`docs/**`, `specs/**`, `features.json`, `plan.md`, `plan.json`).

## Inputs to read (non-negotiable)
- source: **stage_inputs_by_agent**
- docs/product/REQUIREMENTS_BASELINE.md
- docs/product/MARKET_BENCHMARK.md
- docs/product/STORY_MAP.md
- docs/ux/UX_CONTRACT.md
- docs/ux/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
- features.json
- specs/bdd/TRACEABILITY.json
- specs/bdd/BDD_INDEX.json
- docs/engineering/ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/engineering/API.md
- docs/engineering/DATA_MODEL.md

**Output requirement:** Each deliverable you write MUST include an `## Inputs` section listing the canonical docs (by path) that you used.

## Deliverables
- **plan.md** *or* **plan.patch.json** (REQUIRED) → promotes to `plan.md`
  - patch format: JSON `DOC_PATCH` (see .claude/docs/PUBLISHING.md#doc-patches)
  - must include tokens/headings: Inputs, Milestones, Critical path, Definition of Done, Risks, Test strategy
- **plan.json** (REQUIRED) → promotes to `plan.json`
