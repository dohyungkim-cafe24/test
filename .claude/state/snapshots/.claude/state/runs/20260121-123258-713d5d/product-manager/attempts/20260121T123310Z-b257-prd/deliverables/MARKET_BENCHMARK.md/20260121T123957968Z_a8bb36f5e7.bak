## Feature parity and gaps

### Features we must match (table stakes)
| Feature | Market standard | PunchAnalytics approach |
|---------|----------------|------------------------|
| Video upload from smartphone | All competitors support standard video formats | MP4, MOV, WebM with 500MB limit |
| Pose/movement tracking | MediaPipe or proprietary CV models | MediaPipe 33-joint extraction |
| Analysis report generation | Automated or semi-automated | Fully automated via LLM |
| Report sharing | URL or in-app sharing | Unique URL with OG tags for social preview |
| Mobile-friendly interface | Responsive or native apps | Responsive web (mobile-first) |

### Features where we differentiate (competitive advantage)
| Feature | Competitor gap | PunchAnalytics advantage |
|---------|---------------|-------------------------|
| **LLM strategic analysis** | Fight AI: form feedback only; Dartfish: manual annotation | AI-generated national-team-caliber strategic feedback |
| **Sparring-specific analysis** | Fight AI: solo training only | Designed for sparring footage with subject selection |
| **Boxing-specific metrics** | Generic pose estimation | Reach-to-distance ratio, guard recovery speed, upper body tilt |
| **Stamp generation** | Manual tagging required | Automated key moment detection (strikes, defensive actions) |
| **Korean market focus** | No competitors offer Kakao OAuth | Kakao OAuth primary; Korean localization |
| **Individual consumer pricing** | Enterprise focus (Dartfish, iSportsAnalysis) or hardware required (Jabbr) | Web-only, no hardware, consumer-accessible |

### Features we intentionally defer (non-goals for MVP)
| Feature | Competitor offering | Rationale for deferral |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Real-time analysis | Jabbr (live broadcast) | Requires hardware; post-session sufficient for training |
| Native mobile apps | Fight AI (iOS) | Responsive web reduces development scope; native apps in P2 |
| Multi-person tracking | Dartfish (manual) | Manual subject selection simpler and more reliable |
| Coach annotation tools | Dartfish, iSportsAnalysis | Focus on self-service; coach features in P1 |
| Subscription/payments | Fight AI, VueMotion | Defer monetization until product-market fit validated |

### Gaps we must address before launch
1. **Processing time**: Fight AI users report 10+ hour waits; we must target under 5 minutes
2. **Upload reliability**: Fight AI users report upload failures; we need resumable chunked uploads
3. **Analysis accuracy**: Must validate LLM output quality with domain experts before launch
4. **Error messaging**: Clear guidance when videos are unprocessable (Fight AI lacks this)

---
